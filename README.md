# Sorting_algorithms
This repository will show the performance of some sorting algorithms.

# Sorting time
The aim of this program is to verify which algorithm is faster. "sorting_time.cpp" get the execution time of bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort.

# How does it work?
The program takes a number from the user that is going to be the length of the array and generates random numbers that will be sorted by all sorting algorithms. 

To appreciate the results I recommend you a starting point of 700 and a maximum of 100000. Besides, if you want to see the array, uncomment the for loops within each function.
